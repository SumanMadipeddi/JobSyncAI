# Resume-to-Job Matcher and Cold Email Generator 💼🤖

This is an advanced **AI-powered resume-job matching platform** designed to help job seekers instantly tailor their resumes to job postings, generate cold outreach emails, and get personalized project suggestions. Built using **LLMs**, **vector databases**, and **resume analysis**, this tool replicates the real-world logic of how recruiters screen and score resumes using ATS systems.

## 🚀 Overview

Users can upload multiple PDF resumes and provide a job listing URL. The tool:
- Scrapes and cleans the job description
- Extracts structured job requirements (skills, experience, role)
- Matches resumes using both **semantic** and **keyword-based** logic
- Scores each resume on a custom-built **ATS simulation engine**
- Recommends resume improvements (missing skills)
- Suggests domain-specific **project ideas** based on required skills
- Generates a **personalized cold email** for the role

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔹 Gemini-powered LLM reasoning (LLama3 / Gemini Flash)
- 🔹 Cold email generator using resume + job description + skills
- 🔹 ATS-like scoring engine (semantic + keyword + project relevance)
- 🔹 Resume skill gap detection
- 🔹 Project recommendations based on skill-job alignment
- 🔹 Modular architecture with clean separation of concerns

## 📋 Required CSV Format

Before using the tool, users must create a **CSV file** (`suman_projects.csv`) containing project metadata:

### 🔹 Format:
| Project Name         | Skills Used                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Smart News Summarizer| Python, LLM, LangChain, HuggingFace, Streamlit  |
| AI Resume Parser     | NLP, spaCy, Resume Parsing, PDF Extraction      |

This CSV powers the **project similarity and recommendation engine** that maps job-required skills to your past work.
